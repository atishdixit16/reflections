When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In the cases where I want to share it with other people who are working on the same. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
remote may consists of commits made by others which are not neccessarily desirable to you. If auto up-to-date started working it might bring changes into your repositoy and may disturb your work on local system.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is clone in the GitHub. Clone is copying the repository either from GitHub to local or local to local. Branch is a series of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can easily identify the changes made by other collaborators. No mix up of commit will take place.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using pull request and commits on GitHub is easier and better way at it.
